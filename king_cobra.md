# King Cobra

Cobras have 3 different poses.

- No hood - When you cant see the cobra’s hood, he’s relaxed, not  hunting and defending.
- Slight hood - When the Cobra is hunting.
- Full hood - when the cobra is defending itself, mostly from mongooses.

Even though the cobra an extremely deadly snake, his biggest prey is a Mongoose because  the cobra’s venom is not active to the mongoose.

The most venomous snake known is the king cobra. It eats its own species, the cobra. The king cobra’s venom is the same as a cobra, but in a much larger quantity.
